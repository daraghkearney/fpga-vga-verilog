Welcome to my VGA design project! In this report, I walk through how I created a Minecraft Steve head using Verilog on the Basys3 board. I’ll show the set-up, simulation, synthesis, and how I adapted the template code into a working pixel-based design.

## **VGA Design - Minecraft Steve Head**
### **Project Set-Up**
This project uses a Basys3 FPGA board and Vivado to design and implement a VGA controller. The design flow consisted of creating a new project, adding the VGA driver template files, writing additional modules, simulating them, and finally synthesising and implementing the design. Below is a screenshot of the project summary window from my set-up.

### **Template Code**
The original Verilog code provided in the template was designed to demonstrate how to draw simple vertical colour bars on a VGA display. It used the col signals generated by the VGA timing module to determine the position of each pixel. The module then assigned different RGB values based solely on the horizontal col ranges. The RGB outputs were controlled through simple if / else if blocks. The screen was divided into eight vertical stripes with each 80 pixels wide.
### **Simulation**
Simulation was carried out using Vivado’s built-in XSIM tool. I simulated the VGA timing module to check that everything behaved correctly. This step is essential because even a small timing error can break the display output.

### **Synthesis**
After confirming correct behaviour in simulation, the full design was synthesised and implemented on the Basys3. Vivado generated resource usage reports, timing summaries, and implementation floorplans. The design used only a small amount of LUTs and flip-flops since the logic is mostly simple comparisons.
### **Demonstration**
Here is my starting point for Minecraft Steve:

## **My VGA Design Edit - Minecraft Steve Head**
My design idea was to replace the colour-stripe pattern with a pixel-based representation of Minecraft Steve’s face. I used online references to match the skin tones and colours to approximate Steve’s appearance.
Reference: [Minecraft Steve Texture](http://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Player).

### **Code Adaptation**
To create the Steve head, I modified the template’s ColourStripes module by replacing the simple stripes with many small row/col's to add rows aswell as columns corresponding to Steve's features: hair, skin, eyes, nose, and mouth. Here are my progress pictures:

### **Simulation**
I simulated my updated design to verify that the pixel regions mapped correctly. The main thing to check was that the conditional blocks did not overlap or leave gaps. In the waveform, I inspected red, green, and blue outputs in areas corresponding to Steve’s eyes and mouth to confirm correct pixel colouring. Here is my schematic and implemented device:

### **Synthesis**
The synthesis and implementation results for the Steve-head design were almost identical to the original template because the logic is still simple comparisons. Resource usage increased only slightly due to the larger number of if-else conditions. Timing remained well within constraints, and the design met the 25 MHz pixel-clock requirements.
